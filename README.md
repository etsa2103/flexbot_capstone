# BG Flexbot – Networking, CAN, and STO Debugging Notes

## Overview

This document summarizes the investigation into why a **Berkshire Grey Flexbot** robot accepts motion commands via its maintenance web interface and sends CAN traffic, but **does not physically move**.

The root cause was identified as a **safety system (STO) gating issue**, ultimately traced to a **down industrial Ethernet interface (`eth1`)** that prevents the Siemens safety I/O board from arming.

---

## System Architecture (as observed)

### 1. Control Stack Layers

The robot has a layered control architecture:

1. **Application Layer**

   * `fb-maintenance` web interface
   * Accessible at:

     ```
     http://<robot_ip>:61003/
     ```
   * Allows issuing motion commands

2. **Middleware / Controller Layer**

   * Robot control process translates UI commands into CAN messages

3. **Fieldbus Layer**

   * CAN bus (`can1`) connects to AMC motor driver boards
   * Ethernet (`eth1`) connects to Siemens safety I/O board

4. **Safety Layer**

   * Siemens safety / STO I/O board
   * Controls 24 V STO signals to AMC drives
   * Gated by safety logic and industrial Ethernet state

---

## Network Status

### Active Interfaces

```text
wlp1s0   → Wi-Fi (connected, SSH + web UI working)
eth0    → Internal robot network (bridged via br0)
eth1    → Industrial Ethernet to Siemens safety board (NO-CARRIER)
```

Key observation:

```text
eth1: <NO-CARRIER, UP>  → Link detected: no
```

This means:

* The Ethernet PHY is not active
* No industrial fieldbus communication is occurring
* Siemens safety system remains in SAFE state

---

## Wi-Fi Configuration (Sensitive)


The robot uses `wpa_supplicant` with interface-specific configuration:

```
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp1s0.conf
```

Multiple Wi-Fi networks are defined with priority-based fallback.

### Configured Networks

#### 1. Enterprise Wi-Fi (Highest Priority)

```ini
network={
    ssid="bg-flexbot-net"
    key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    eap=TLS
    identity="setupident@host.com"
    ca_cert="/etc/certs/ca.pem"
    client_cert="/etc/certs/setup.pem"
    private_key="/etc/certs/setup.key"
    private_key_passwd="ucoc0siu2eiPhi8ahwo9"
    priority=3
}
```

* Certificate-based authentication (no PSK)
* Intended for factory / corporate environment
* Requires valid certs and backend infrastructure

---

#### 2. WPA-PSK Hotspot / Lab Network

```ini
network={
    ssid="bg-flexbot-wifi6"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    psk="rac@bg1922"
    priority=2
}
```

* Used successfully with a user-created hotspot
* Robot connected automatically
* Assigned IP example:

  ```
  192.168.50.160/24
  ```

---

#### 3. WPA-PSK Fallback Network

```ini
network={
    ssid="bg-flexbot-psk"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    psk="N0w1f14youTod@y"
    priority=1
}
```

* Lowest priority
* Likely backup or emergency access network

---

### Wi-Fi Notes

* Interface name is **`wlp1s0`**, not `wlan0`
* Connection verified via:

  ```bash
  iw dev wlp1s0 link
  ip a show wlp1s0
  ```
* SSH and maintenance web UI confirmed working over Wi-Fi

---

## CAN Bus Observations

### CAN Traffic Present

* `candump can1` shows:

  * Periodic command frames
  * Heartbeat-like frames (e.g. `0x701`)
  * Feedback-like frames (small signed values)

This confirms:

* Motion commands **are being generated**
* CAN communication **is functional**
* Lack of motion is **not** a CAN issue

---

## STO (Safe Torque Off) Observations

### AMC Drive Behavior

* STO indicator LEDs on AMC motor drives are **OFF**
* This indicates **no 24 V present on STO inputs**
* Drives therefore **refuse to generate torque**

### Wiring Insight

* STO inputs on all AMC drives are wired to a **central Siemens safety I/O board**
* The Siemens board:

  * Is powered by the robot battery
  * Is connected to the robot computer via **Ethernet**
  * Controls STO centrally for all drives

---

## Siemens Safety I/O Board Role

From behavior and wiring, the Siemens board is acting as:

* A **safety-rated STO controller**
* Likely a PROFINET / PROFIsafe or similar module
* Outputs dual-channel 24 V STO **only when safety logic is healthy**

Key principle:

> **If the safety Ethernet link is down, STO outputs are intentionally disabled.**

---

## Root Cause Identified

### Primary Blocker

**`eth1` has NO-CARRIER (no physical / logical link)**

This causes the following chain:

1. `eth1` is down
2. Siemens safety board does not see its fieldbus master
3. Safety logic remains in SAFE / STOP state
4. STO outputs remain at 0 V
5. AMC drives do not enable torque
6. Robot does not move

Everything else (CAN, UI, software) is downstream of this.

---

## Blue Buttons (Safety Acknowledge)

The robot has **two blue buttons**, one on each side.

Based on standard Siemens / warehouse robot design, these are likely:

* Dual-hand **safety acknowledge / reset** buttons
* Must be pressed **simultaneously**
* Often required to:

  * Exit safe stop
  * Arm STO
  * Enable fieldbus communication

This is a **designed human acknowledgment step**, not a software command.

---

## Safety Note (Critical)

* STO and Siemens safety circuits are **certified safety systems**
* Bypassing safety buttons or shorting wires can:

  * Latch permanent safety faults
  * Cause unexpected motion
  * Damage hardware or injure people

## STO Bypass Configuration (All Four Driver Boards)

> **WARNING**  
> The STO (Safe Torque Off) inputs on the AMC motor driver boards are part of a
> **certified functional safety system**.  
> The procedure described below **intentionally disables all safety protections**
> and must only be used for controlled commissioning and debugging.

---

### Overview

To enable motor operation without the Siemens safety circuit, the STO system was
**intentionally bypassed on all four AMC driver boards**.

---

### Procedure (Repeated Identically on All Four Drives)

For **each AMC driver board (Driver 1–4)**:

1. **Locate the STO terminals** on the AMC drive:
   - `STO1+`
   - `STO2+`
   - `STO COM` / `STO GND`

2. **Apply a direct +24 V DC supply** to:
   - `STO1+`
   - `STO2+`

3. **Verify the following conditions**:
   - Both STO channels (`STO1` and `STO2`) receive **continuous 24 V**
   - The **same 24 V supply** is used for all four driver boards
   - The 24 V supply ground is correctly referenced to the drive logic ground,
     per AMC documentation

4. This configuration was applied **identically to all four AMC driver boards**,
   resulting in:
   - STO asserted (logic-high) on every drive
   - All drives permitted to generate torque when enabled via CAN

---

### Resulting System State

With this configuration:

- **STO functionality is fully disabled**
- Siemens safety relays, E-stop chains, and interlocks are **inactive**
- Motor torque can be enabled **purely via CAN commands**
- Any software, wiring, or control fault can cause **immediate motor motion**

---

### Safety Implications

Bypassing STO can:

- Defeat Safe Torque Off protection
- Cause unexpected or uncontrolled motion
- Latch irreversible drive faults
- Damage hardware
- Can also cause Injury


---

## Current Status Summary

| Subsystem          | Status       |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Wi-Fi / SSH        | ✅ Working   |
| Custom Linux UI    | ✅ Working   |
| CAN Bus            | ✅ Active    |
| Motion Commands    | ✅ Sent      |
| STO Outputs        | ✅ Enabled   |
| eth1 Link          | ✅ Enabled   |
| Motor Torque       | ✅ Enabled   |

---

## Key Takeaway

> **The robot is healthy, but intentionally safe.**
> Motion is blocked because the Siemens safety system has not armed, and that arming is gated by the `eth1` industrial Ethernet link.

Once `eth1` comes up, existing motion commands should immediately produce movement.

```

**Verify enabled status:**

```bash
cansend can0 602#4041600000000000
```

Expected statusword: `0x0637` (bytes `37 06`)

---

## RPDO Inspection

### Object Dictionary Locations

For RPDO k (1..4):

| What | Object | Subindex |
|------|--------|----------|
| RPDOk COB-ID | 0x1400 + (k-1) | :01 |
| RPDOk Transmission Type | 0x1400 + (k-1) | :02 |
| RPDOk Mapping Count | 0x1600 + (k-1) | :00 |
| RPDOk Mapping Entry i | 0x1600 + (k-1) | :i |

### 1. Check if RPDO is Active

Read RPDO4 COB-ID (0x1403:01):

```bash
cansend can0 602#4003140100000000
```

**Interpret 4 bytes (little-endian):**
- `01 02 00 80` → `0x80000201` → Disabled
- `01 02 00 00` → `0x00000201` → Enabled

**Rule:** If bit 31 is set (`0x80000000`), PDO is disabled.

### 2. Find RPDO Mapping

Read mapping count for RPDO4 (0x1603:00):

```bash
cansend can0 602#4003160000000000
```

Read mapping entries:

```bash
cansend can0 602#4003160100000000
cansend can0 602#4003160200000000
```

**Mapping entry format (32-bit):**
```
(Index 16-bit) | (Subindex 8-bit) | (Size-in-bits 8-bit)
```

**Examples:**
- `0x60400010` → 0x6040:00, 16 bits → Controlword
- `0x60FF0020` → 0x60FF:00, 32 bits → Target Velocity
- `0x607A0020` → 0x607A:00, 32 bits → Target Position

### 3. Check Transmission Type

Read RPDO4 transmission type (0x1403:02):

```bash
cansend can0 602#4003140200000000
```

**Interpretation:**
- `0x01` (or `0x00..0xF0`) → Synchronous (requires SYNC)
- `0xFF` → Asynchronous (immediate)

---

## RPDO Activation

If COB-ID shows `0x8XXXXXXX` (disabled), enable it:

```bash
# 1. Enter Pre-Operational
cansend can0 000#8002

# 2. Write COB-ID with bit 31 cleared (example: 0x80000301 → 0x00000301)
cansend can0 602#2301140101030000

# 3. Verify
cansend can0 602#4001140100000000

# 4. Start node
cansend can0 000#0102
```

---

## Discovered PDO Layout

### RPDO2 (COB-ID 0x301)

**Mapping:**
- 0x6040 (Controlword, 16 bits)
- 0x6060 (Mode of Operation, 8 bits)

**Payload:** `[CW_L][CW_H][MODE]`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Set Profile Velocity (mode=3) and enable
cansend can0 301#0F0003

# Set Profile Position (mode=1)
cansend can0 301#0F0001
```

### RPDO4 (COB-ID 0x201)

**Mapping:**
- 0x6040 (Controlword, 16 bits)
- 0x60FF (Target Velocity, 32 bits)

**Transmission Type:** 0x01 (SYNC-driven)

**Payload:** `[CW_L][CW_H][VEL0][VEL1][VEL2][VEL3][00][00]`

---

## Velocity Control

### SYNC Generation

**Terminal A (50 Hz SYNC loop):**

```bash
I recommend logging the candump by running the run_motor.sh in PCAN-View and find the appropriate cycle time
```


```bash
while true; do
  cansend can0 080#
  sleep 0.02
done
```

**Terminal B (Commands):**

```bash
# Ensure node is operational and enabled first
cansend can0 301#0F0003                 # Set Profile Velocity mode
cansend can0 201#0F00881300000000       # CW=0x000F, vel=+5000
```

**Stop:**

```bash
cansend can0 201#0F00000000000000
```

**Read actual velocity:**

```bash
cansend can0 602#406C600000000000
```

### Optional: Make RPDO4 Asynchronous

```bash
cansend can0 000#8002
cansend can0 602#2F031402FF000000   # Set 0x1403:02 = 0xFF
cansend can0 000#0102
```

---

## Position Control

### RPDO3 Configuration

- **COB-ID:** Typically `0x401 or 0x501` (after enabling) 
- **Mapping:**
  - 0x6040 (Controlword, 16 bits)
  - 0x607A (Target Position, 32 bits)

### Set Profile Parameters

```bash
# Profile Velocity = 100000
cansend can0 602#23816000A0860100

# Profile Acceleration = 200000
cansend can0 602#23836000400D0300

# Profile Deceleration = 200000
cansend can0 602#23846000400D0300
```

### Relative Move Example

**Move +10000 counts:**

```bash
# Trigger (0x007F: enabled + immediate + relative + new-setpoint)
cansend can0 401#7F00102700000000

# Clear toggle (0x006F)
cansend can0 401#6F00102700000000
```

**Read actual position:**

```bash
cansend can0 602#4064600000000000
```

---

## Diagnostics

```bash
# Statusword
cansend can0 602#4041600000000000

# Mode Display
cansend can0 602#4061600000000000

## Troubleshooting

### Checklist

- [ ] **Node alive?** Look for heartbeat at `0x700+N` (e.g., `0x702`)
- [ ] **NMT state correct?** Run `cansend can0 000#0102`
- [ ] **CiA-402 enabled?** Statusword should show `0x0637`
- [ ] **RPDOs enabled?** Check bit 31 of COB-ID (`0x140x:01`)
- [ ] **Correct COB-ID?** Verify drive configuration
- [ ] **RPDO SYNC-driven?** If transmission type is `0x01`, send SYNC or change to `0xFF`
- [ ] **PDO mapping matches payload?** Verify mapping entries match your data structure

- [Understanding Your Motors](#understanding-your-motors)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Scripts Overview](#scripts-overview)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)

---

## Hardware Requirements

- Differential drive robot with CANopen motor controllers
- CAN-to-USB adapter (or built-in CAN interface)
- Linux computer (tested on Ubuntu)
- 2x Motors with CANopen support (tested with nodes 1 and 2)

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- python-can library
- SocketCAN (included in Linux kernel)

### Installation
```bash
# Install python-can
pip install python-can

# Verify SocketCAN is available
sudo modprobe can
sudo modprobe can_raw
```

---

## Initial Setup

### 1. Configure CAN Interface

First, set up your CAN interface. Replace `can0` with your interface name if different:
```bash
# Bring up CAN interface at 1Mbit/s (adjust bitrate if needed)
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up

# Verify interface is up
ip link show can0
```

**Make it persistent** (optional):

Create `/etc/systemd/network/80-can.network`:
```ini
[Match]
Name=can0

[CAN]
BitRate=1000000
```

### 2. Verify CAN Communication

Before running any scripts, verify you can see CAN traffic:
```bash
# Install can-utils if not present
sudo apt-get install can-utils

# Monitor CAN bus (Ctrl+C to stop)
candump can0
```

You should see CAN messages if your motors are powered on.

---

## Understanding Your Motors

### Identifying Motor Node IDs

Motors communicate using CANopen node IDs. Common patterns:
- **Node 1** (Left motor): Uses IDs `0x601` (SDO request), `0x581` (SDO response), `0x501` (RPDO)
- **Node 2** (Right motor): Uses IDs `0x602`, `0x582`, `0x502`

### Discovery Script

Use this script to find which nodes are responding:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""ping.py - Discover active CANopen nodes"""
import can
import time

bus = can.Bus(channel='can0', interface='socketcan')

print("Scanning for CANopen nodes...")

for node_id in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nTrying Node {node_id}...")
    
    # Send SDO read request for statusword (0x6041)
    req_id = 0x600 + node_id
    resp_id = 0x580 + node_id
    
    msg = can.Message(
        arbitration_id=req_id,
        data=[0x40, 0x41, 0x60, 0x00, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        is_extended_id=False
    )
    bus.send(msg)
    time.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Check for response
    response = bus.recv(timeout=0.5)
    if response and response.arbitration_id == resp_id:
        print(f"  ✓ Node {node_id} responded!")
        print(f"    Response: {response}")
    else:
        print(f"  ✗ No response from Node {node_id}")

bus.shutdown()
```

Run it:
```bash
python3 ping.py
```

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Capture Motor Configuration

If your robot came with proprietary control software, capture the CAN traffic to understand the initialization sequence:
```bash
# Start logging (in one terminal)
candump can0 -l

# Run the proprietary software to start motors (in another terminal/computer)

# Stop logging with Ctrl+C
# This creates candump-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log
```

### Step 2: Initialize Motors

Create separate initialization scripts for each motor. Here's the template:

**`init_left_motor.py`** (Node 1):
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Left Motor (Node 1) - Complete Initialization
"""
import can
import struct
import time

bus = can.Bus(channel='can0', interface='socketcan')
NODE = 1

def wait_for_sdo_response(timeout=0.5):
    """Wait for SDO response"""
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < timeout:
        msg = bus.recv(timeout=0.1)
        if msg and msg.arbitration_id == (0x580 + NODE):
            return True
    return False

def send_sdo(data):
    """Send SDO and wait for response"""
    bus.send(can.Message(
        arbitration_id=0x600 + NODE, 
        data=data, 
        is_extended_id=False
    ))
    return wait_for_sdo_response()

def send_cmd(ctrl, vel=0):
    """Send RPDO command + SYNC"""
    msg = can.Message(
        arbitration_id=0x500 + NODE,
        data=struct.pack('<HiH', ctrl, vel, 0),
        is_extended_id=False
    )
    bus.send(msg)
    time.sleep(0.002)
    
    # Send SYNC
    sync = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x080, data=[], is_extended_id=False)
    bus.send(sync)
    time.sleep(0.008)

def send_nmt(data):
    """Send NMT command"""
    bus.send(can.Message(
        arbitration_id=0x000, 
        data=data, 
        is_extended_id=False
    ))
    time.sleep(0.1)

print("="*70)
print(f"MOTOR NODE {NODE} - INITIALIZATION")
print("="*70)

# Reset node
print(f"\n[1/11] Resetting Node {NODE}...")
send_nmt(bytes([0x80, NODE]))
time.sleep(0.5)

# Configure PDOs, motor parameters, etc.

print(f"\n✓ MOTOR NODE {NODE} INITIALIZED AND ENGAGED!")
print("  You should have heard a click sound")

bus.shutdown()
```

**For Node 2 (Right motor)**: Copy the script and change `NODE = 1` to `NODE = 2`.

Run initialization:
```bash
python3 init_left_motor.py
python3 init_right_motor.py
```

You should hear a click/engagement sound from each motor.

## Troubleshooting

### Motor doesn't engage (no click sound)

**Symptom**: Initialization runs without errors but no click sound.

**Solution**: Make sure you're sending the RPDO state machine commands at the end of initialization:
```python
send_cmd(0x0080, 0)  # Fault reset
for _ in range(5):
    send_cmd(0x0006, 0)  # Shutdown
for _ in range(5):
    send_cmd(0x0007, 0)  # Switch on
for _ in range(10):
    send_cmd(0x000F, 0)  # Enable operation
```

### Motor reports "Operation Enabled" but doesn't move

**Symptom**: Status shows `0x0637` but velocity stays at 0.

**Cause**: Sending velocity via SDO instead of RPDO.

**Solution**: Use RPDO commands with SYNC:
```python
send_cmd(0x000F, velocity_command)  # Not send_sdo!
```

### "No SDO response" warnings

**Symptom**: Warnings during initialization but motor still works.

**Cause**: Timing issues or non-critical SDO reads.

**Solution**: Usually safe to ignore if motor engages. If problematic, increase timeout:
```python
def wait_for_sdo_response(timeout=1.0):  # Increase from 0.5 to 1.0
```

### CAN interface not found
```bash
# Check interface name
ip link show

# Bring up interface
sudo ip link set can0 up

# Check for errors
dmesg | grep can
```

### Wrong bitrate

**Symptom**: No CAN traffic or garbled messages.

**Solution**: Common CAN bitrates are 125k, 250k, 500k, 1M. Try:
```bash
sudo ip link set can0 down
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

### Statusword stuck at 0x0228 (Quick Stop)

**Symptom**: Motor in Quick Stop state, not ready.

**Solution**: Send fault reset before enabling:
```python
send_sdo(bytes([0x2B, 0x40, 0x60, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]))  # Fault reset
time.sleep(0.5)
# Then proceed with normal state machine
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Velocity Feedback

Read actual motor velocity (0x606C):
```python
def read_actual_velocity(node):
    """Read actual velocity from motor"""
    # Send SDO read request for 0x606C
    req = can.Message(
        arbitration_id=0x600 + node,
        data=[0x40, 0x6C, 0x60, 0x00, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        is_extended_id=False
    )
    bus.send(req)
    time.sleep(0.05)
    
    # Parse response
    resp = bus.recv(timeout=0.5)
    if resp and len(resp.data) >= 8:
        actual_cmd = struct.unpack('<i', bytes(resp.data[4:8]))[0]
        actual_rpm = actual_cmd / CMD_PER_WHEEL_RPM
        return actual_rpm
    return None
```

### Closed-Loop Control
```python
class MotorController:
    def __init__(self, node, kp=0.1):
        self.node = node
        self.kp = kp  # Proportional gain
    
    def set_velocity_closed_loop(self, target_rpm, duration):
        """Maintain target velocity with feedback"""
        start = time.time()
        
        while time.time() - start < duration:
            actual_rpm = read_actual_velocity(self.node)
            if actual_rpm is not None:
                error = target_rpm - actual_rpm
                correction = self.kp * error
                adjusted_rpm = target_rpm + correction
                
                cmd = int(round(adjusted_rpm * CMD_PER_WHEEL_RPM))
                send_cmd_motor(self.node, 0x000F, cmd)
            
            time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Emergency Stop
```python
def emergency_stop():
    """Immediate stop for both motors"""
    for _ in range(50):
        send_cmd_motor(1, 0x000F, 0)
        send_cmd_motor(2, 0x000F, 0)
        send_sync()
        time.sleep(0.001)
```

### Calibration

Find your `CMD_PER_WHEEL_RPM` constant:
```python
# 1. Command a known value (e.g., 100000)
# 2. Measure actual wheel RPM with tachometer or encoder
# 3. Calculate: CMD_PER_WHEEL_RPM = command_value / measured_rpm
```

## Understanding CANopen Communication

### SDO (Service Data Object)
- Used for configuration and setup
- Request/response protocol
- Node 1: `0x601` (request) → `0x581` (response)

### RPDO (Receive Process Data Object)
- Used for real-time control commands
- No response required
- Node 1: `0x501` (commands)

### SYNC
- Triggers PDO processing
- Broadcast message: `0x080`
- Sent after RPDO commands

### NMT (Network Management)
- Controls node states (reset, start, stop)
- Broadcast or addressed
- `0x000`

# Hybrid Boot Setup: BG Kernel + Debian Userland on iMX7

## Overview

This guide describes how to create a hybrid embedded Linux system that combines:
- **BG's hardware-enabled kernel** (with full peripheral support)
- **Debian's userland** (familiar package management and tools)
- **Existing U-Boot** (no bootloader modifications needed)

This approach is ideal when you have a vendor kernel with proper hardware support but want the flexibility of a standard Linux distribution.

## Hardware Setup

- **Platform**: CompuLab CL-SOM-iMX7
- **Target Device**: FlexBot2 (BG custom board)
- **Storage**: 
  - SD Card (29.7GB) - Original BG system
  - eMMC (14.5GB) - Debian installation
- **Peripherals**: 
  - Ethernet (eth0, eth1)
  - WiFi (Intel AX200)
  - IMU (Xsens MTi v2 on /dev/ttymxc4)
  - CAN bus interfaces

## Prerequisites

### What You Need

1. **Working BG system** on SD card (for extracting kernel/DTB)
2. **Debian system installed on eMMC** (see installation steps below)
3. **Serial console access** to the device
4. **Development computer** with:
   - WSL/Linux environment
   - SD card reader
   - Network access to the device

### Installing Debian on eMMC (Required First Step)

**Important**: The CompuLab CL-SOM-iMX7 does not come with Debian pre-installed on the eMMC. You must install it first before proceeding with this hybrid setup.

#### Download Debian Image from CompuLab

1. Visit the CompuLab support page:
```
   https://www.compulab.com/products/computer-on-modules/cl-som-imx7-freescale-i-mx-7-computer-on-module/
```

2. Navigate to **Downloads** → **Software** → **Debian Images**

3. Download the Debian image for CL-SOM-iMX7:
   - Look for: `cl-som-imx7-debian-<version>.img.xz` or similar
   - Example: `debian-buster-cl-som-imx7.img.xz`

#### Flash Debian to eMMC

**Method 1: Using SD Card as Installation Media**
```bash
# On your development computer:

# Extract the image
xz -d cl-som-imx7-debian-*.img.xz

# Flash to SD card (WARNING: This will erase the SD card!)
sudo dd if=cl-som-imx7-debian-*.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync

# Insert SD card into iMX7 and boot
# The installer will guide you through installing to eMMC
```

**Method 2: Direct eMMC Flash (via U-Boot/Fastboot)**

Refer to CompuLab's official documentation for detailed eMMC flashing procedures:
```
https://mediawiki.compulab.com/w/index.php?title=CL-SOM-iMX7:_Debian
```

#### Verify Debian Installation

After installation, boot from eMMC and verify:
```bash
# Check eMMC partitions
lsblk
# Should show:
# mmcblk2      179:0    0 14.5G  0 disk
# ├─mmcblk2p1  179:1    0  100M  0 part
# └─mmcblk2p2  179:2    0 14.4G  0 part /

# Check Debian version
cat /etc/debian_version
# Should show: 10.x (Buster) or similar

# Check kernel (this will be replaced later)
uname -a
```

#### Default Credentials

CompuLab's Debian image typically uses:
- **Username**: `root` or `debian`
- **Password**: `debian` or `root`
- **Note**: Change these after first boot for security
```bash
# Change root password
passwd root

# Change debian user password (if exists)
passwd debian
```

#### Initial Network Setup
```bash
# Ethernet should auto-configure via DHCP
ip a show eth0

# If needed, manually configure:
dhclient eth0

# Test connectivity
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```

### Once Debian is Installed

After successfully installing and booting Debian from eMMC, proceed with the hybrid setup steps below to integrate BG's hardware-enabled kernel.

**Note**: The initial Debian installation uses CompuLab's kernel. This kernel may have limited hardware support. The hybrid setup replaces it with BG's fully-featured kernel while keeping Debian's userland intact.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Extract Required Files from BG SD Card

#### On Your Development Computer

Insert the BG SD card and copy the necessary partitions:
```bash
# Identify the SD card device (e.g., /dev/sdb on Linux, \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2 on Windows)
lsblk

# Copy partition 13 (kernel)
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX13 of=partition_13.img bs=1M

# Copy partition 12 (DTB)
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX12 of=partition_12.img bs=64K

# Verify the files
file partition_13.img
# Should show: Linux kernel ARM boot executable zImage (little-endian)

file partition_12.img
# Should show: Device Tree Blob version 17
```

#### Alternative: Extract from Running BG System

If you can boot the BG system:
```bash
# SSH into BG system
ssh root@bg-flexbot2

# Copy kernel from partition
dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p13 of=/tmp/zImage bs=1M

# Copy DTB from partition
dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p12 of=/tmp/imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb bs=64K
```

### 2. Prepare Boot Files

#### On Development Computer
```bash
cd /path/to/extracted/files

# Rename kernel for clarity
cp partition_13.img zImage-bg

# Rename DTB
cp partition_12.img imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb

# Verify files
file zImage-bg
file imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb

# Create transfer package
mkdir bg-boot-files
cp zImage-bg bg-boot-files/
cp imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb bg-boot-files/
tar czf bg-boot-files.tar.gz bg-boot-files/

# Verify package
tar -tzf bg-boot-files.tar.gz
```

### 3. Collect U-Boot Environment Variables

You need to compare U-Boot environments from both systems to understand boot parameters.

#### From BG System (SD Card U-Boot)
```bash
# Boot BG system, interrupt U-Boot (press any key during countdown)
# At U-Boot prompt:
printenv > /tmp/bg-uboot-env.txt

# Key variables to note:
# - fdtfile=imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb
# - console=ttymxc0
# - loadaddr=0x80800000
# - fdtaddr=0x83000000
```

#### From Debian System (eMMC U-Boot)
```bash
# Boot Debian system, interrupt U-Boot
# At U-Boot prompt:
printenv > /tmp/debian-uboot-env.txt

# Key variables to note:
# - fdtfile=imx7d-cl-som-imx7.dtb
# - mmcdev=1 (eMMC device)
# - mmcpart=1 (boot partition)
# - mmcblk=2 (block device number)
```

### 4. Transfer Files to Target Device

Since Debian's kernel doesn't support peripherals yet, use the BG system to do the installation.

#### Option A: Via Network (Using BG System)
```bash
# Boot into BG system from SD card
# Transfer files via SSH
scp bg-boot-files.tar.gz root@<bg-ip-address>:/tmp/
```

#### Option B: Via USB/SD Card
```bash
# Copy bg-boot-files.tar.gz to USB drive or SD card partition 19
# On Windows: Copy to the large partition on SD card

# Then on BG system:
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb  # If USB drive
# OR
# File is in /rw if copied to SD partition 19
```

### 5. Install Boot Files on Debian's eMMC

**Important**: This must be done from the BG system, as it has working hardware drivers.
```bash
# Boot BG system from SD card
# Extract the files
cd /tmp
tar xzf bg-boot-files.tar.gz
ls -lh bg-boot-files/

# Mount Debian's eMMC boot partition
mkdir -p /mnt/debian-boot
mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt/debian-boot

# Backup existing Debian files (optional but recommended)
mkdir -p /mnt/debian-boot/backup
cp /mnt/debian-boot/zImage /mnt/debian-boot/backup/zImage-debian
cp /mnt/debian-boot/*.dtb /mnt/debian-boot/backup/

# Install BG kernel and DTB
cp bg-boot-files/zImage-bg /mnt/debian-boot/zImage
cp bg-boot-files/imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb /mnt/debian-boot/

# Verify installation
ls -lh /mnt/debian-boot/
file /mnt/debian-boot/zImage
file /mnt/debian-boot/imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb

# Sync and unmount
sync
umount /mnt/debian-boot
```

### 6. Configure U-Boot Environment

Reboot and interrupt U-Boot to boot from eMMC. You need to modify Debian's U-Boot environment to load BG's DTB and set correct boot parameters.
```bash
# Reboot and interrupt U-Boot
reboot
# Press any key during countdown to stop at U-Boot prompt

# Change DTB filename to BG's device tree
setenv fdtfile imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb

# Fix root device path for BG kernel
# BG's kernel sees eMMC as mmcblk1, not mmcblk2
setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init'

# Verify settings
printenv fdtfile mmcpart mmcargs

# Save changes
saveenv

# Boot
run emmcboot
```

### 7. Boot and Verify

After running `emmcboot`, you should see:

1. U-Boot loads BG's kernel from eMMC
2. U-Boot loads BG's DTB from eMMC
3. Kernel boots with full hardware support
4. System mounts Debian rootfs
5. Init starts Debian userland

Expected boot messages:
```
[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0
[    0.000000] Linux version 5.4.149-yocto-standard-fb2-gitAUTOINC+...
...
[    4.xxx] pci 0000:01:00.0: [8086:2723] type 00 class 0x028000  (WiFi detected)
...
Debian GNU/Linux 10 cl-debian ttymxc0
```

Login and verify hardware:
```bash
# Check kernel version (should be BG's)
uname -a
# Linux cl-debian 5.4.149-yocto-standard-fb2-gitAUTOINC+f1c0d2bad0 #1 SMP PREEMPT

# Check network interfaces
ip a
# Should show: eth0, eth1, wlp1s0 (WiFi), can0, can1

# Check serial ports
ls /dev/ttymxc*
# Should show: ttymxc0, ttymxc2, ttymxc3, ttymxc4, ttymxc5, ttymxc6

# Check I2C buses
i2cdetect -l
# Should show: i2c-1, i2c-2, i2c-3
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Waiting for root device /dev/mmcblkXpY"

**Cause**: Wrong root device path for the kernel.

**Solution**: Try different device numbers:
```bash
# At U-Boot prompt, try these alternatives:
setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init'
# OR
setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} root=/dev/mmcblk2p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init'

saveenv
run emmcboot
```

### Issue: "Kernel panic - init failed (error -2)"

**Cause**: Kernel can't find init system.

**Solution**: Add explicit init path:
```bash
setenv mmcargs 'setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init'
saveenv
run emmcboot
```

### Issue: "Cannot boot from eMMC"

**Cause**: Files not properly installed or U-Boot looking in wrong place.

**Solution**: Manually verify and load:
```bash
# At U-Boot prompt:
mmc dev 1
mmc rescan
mmc part

# List files in boot partition
ls mmc 1:1

# Manually load and boot
load mmc 1:1 ${loadaddr} zImage
load mmc 1:1 ${fdtaddr} imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb
setenv bootargs 'console=ttymxc0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init'
bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}
```

## Final U-Boot Configuration

Your working U-Boot environment should have:
```bash
fdtfile=imx7d-bg-flexbot2.dtb
mmcdev=1
mmcpart=1
mmcargs=setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rootwait rw init=/sbin/init
```

Save with:
```bash
saveenv
```

## Post-Installation Setup

### 1. Install SSH Server
```bash
# Fix any interrupted package installations
dpkg --configure -a

# Install SSH
apt-get update
apt-get install -y openssh-server

# Set root password
passwd root

# Enable and start SSH
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl start ssh

# Verify
systemctl status ssh
```

### 2. Configure Network
```bash
# Ethernet should work automatically
# For WiFi:
apt-get install -y wpasupplicant wireless-tools

# Configure WiFi
wpa_passphrase "SSID" "password" > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp1s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
dhclient wlp1s0
```

### 3. Install Development Tools
```bash
apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip \
    python3-serial \
    git \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    htop \
    vim \
    screen
```

## Hardware Verification Checklist

After successful boot, verify all hardware:

- [ ] **Ethernet**: `ip a` shows eth0 and eth1
- [ ] **WiFi**: `ip a` shows wlp1s0
- [ ] **Serial Ports**: `/dev/ttymxc*` devices exist
- [ ] **I2C**: `i2cdetect -l` shows i2c buses
- [ ] **CAN**: `ip a` shows can0, can1
- [ ] **IMU**: `/dev/ttymxc4` accessible (Xsens MTi)
- [ ] **USB**: Devices detected in `lsusb`

## Working with the IMU (Xsens MTi)

The Xsens IMU is on `/dev/ttymxc4` at 115200 baud:
```bash
# Test IMU communication
stty -F /dev/ttymxc4 115200 raw -echo
timeout 5 cat /dev/ttymxc4 | hexdump -C

# Should see 0xFA (preamble) in the output
```

See the companion `imu_euler_only.py` script for Python interface.

## Key Advantages of This Approach

✅ **No U-Boot recompilation** - Uses existing bootloader
✅ **Hardware support intact** - All vendor drivers work
✅ **Standard Linux userland** - Full Debian package ecosystem
✅ **Reversible** - Can restore original kernel from backup
✅ **Low risk** - Only modifies boot partition files

## Partitioning Overview

### BG SD Card (mmcblk0 when inserted)
- Partitions 1-12: Boot components, SPL, U-Boot, DTB
- Partition 13: Kernel (set0)
- Partition 15: Kernel (set1)
- Partition 16: Rootfs (set0)
- Partition 17: Rootfs (set1)
- Partition 19: User data

### Debian eMMC (mmcblk1 in BG, mmcblk2 in Debian)
**Installed from CompuLab's Debian image**
- mmcblk1boot0/mmcblk2boot0: U-Boot binary
- mmcblk1p1/mmcblk2p1: Boot partition (FAT, 100MB) - **Modified with BG files**
- mmcblk1p2/mmcblk2p2: Root filesystem (ext4, 14.4GB) - **Debian userland**

**Note**: Device naming differs between kernels:
- BG kernel sees eMMC as `mmcblk1`
- Debian kernel sees eMMC as `mmcblk2`
- This is why boot arguments use `mmcblk1p2` for root


# Peripherals Testing – IMU, LCD, and LED Control

This section documents Python scripts for testing and controlling peripheral devices on the robot.

---

## Available Scripts

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)

| Script | Description | Serial Port | Baud Rate |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|
| `imu_read_accel_gyro.py` | Reads accelerometer (m/s²) and gyroscope (rad/s) data | `/dev/ttymxc4` | 115200 |
| `imu_euler_only.py` | Reads orientation data (roll, pitch, yaw) | `/dev/ttymxc4` | 115200 |
| `imu_to_lcd.py` | Streams IMU data to LCD display at 5 Hz | IMU: `/dev/ttymxc4`<br>LCD: `/dev/ttymxc2` | IMU: 115200<br>LCD: 57600 |

---

### LCD Display

| Script | Description | Serial Port | Baud Rate |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|
| `lcd_test.py` | Tests LCD display with custom messages | `/dev/ttymxc2` | 57600 |

---

### LED Indicators

| Script | Description | Control Method |
|------|------------|----------------|
| `led_sequence.py` | Runs RGB LED test sequence | Sysfs (`/sys/class/leds/`) |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Test IMU
```bash
python3 imu_read_accel_gyro.py
```

### 2. Test LCD
```bash
python3 lcd_test.py
```

### 3. Test LEDs
```bash
python3 led_sequence.py
```

### 4. Combined IMU → LCD Display
```bash
python3 imu_to_lcd.py
```

---

## IMU Configuration

The IMU uses the **Xsens MTi binary protocol**.

```python
# Standard initialization sequence
send_packet(0x30)          # Enter configuration mode
send_packet(0xC0, cfg_data) # Configure output data IDs
send_packet(0x10)          # Enter measurement mode
```

### Enabled Output Data IDs (DIDs)

| Data | Data ID | Format | Units |
|----|--------|--------|-------|
| Accelerometer | `0x4020` | 3 × float32 | m/s² |
| Gyroscope | `0x8020` | 3 × float32 | rad/s |
| Euler Angles | `0x2030` | 3 × float32 | degrees |

---

## LCD Control Commands

LCD communication is via UART using command prefix `0xFE`.

| Function | Command |
|--------|--------|
| Initialize | `0xFE 0x41` |
| Clear display | `0xFE 0x51` |
| Set cursor | `0xFE 0x45 + address` |

### Line Addresses

- Line 1 → `0x00`
- Line 2 → `0x40`
- Line 3 → `0x14`
- Line 4 → `0x54`

---

## LED Control

LEDs are controlled through **Linux sysfs**, not UART/I²C/CAN.

### LED Paths

- Red → `/sys/class/leds/red:status/brightness`
- Green → `/sys/class/leds/green:status/brightness`
- Blue → `/sys/class/leds/blue:status/brightness`

### Brightness Values

- `0` → OFF
- `255` → ON (full brightness)

---

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyserial
```

---

## Permissions

```bash
# Allow serial access
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-----|------------------|
| IMU: No data | Check `/dev/ttymxc4` exists and permissions |
| LCD: Blank | Adjust LCD contrast potentiometer |
| LEDs not lighting | Check sysfs write permissions |
| Serial port missing | Verify device tree configuration |
| Permission denied | Run with `sudo` or check user groups |

## Contributing

If you're adapting this for different motors:

1. Capture your motor's CAN traffic with `candump`
2. Identify the SDO configuration sequence
3. Adapt the initialization scripts
4. Test with a single motor first
5. Submit a PR with your motor configuration!

## Acknowledgments

- Built using [python-can](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/)
- CANopen protocol specification: CiA 301
- Tested on differential drive robots with CANopen motor controllers

---

## Support

Having issues? Check:
1. CAN interface is up: `ip link show can0`
2. Correct bitrate: Try 125k, 250k, 500k, 1M
3. Motor power is on
4. Correct node IDs (use `ping.py`)
5. Initialization script completes successfully
6. You hear the engagement click

Still stuck? Open an issue with:
- Your `candump` log
- Output from initialization script
- Motor controller model

---

## Important Notes

- Many drives accept SDO writes for setpoints but only act on PDO commands
- In synchronous configurations, no SYNC = no motion
- Always verify PDO mapping—it's the source of truth for what the drive expects
